# Shopify Scripts

Shopify Scripts are small pieces of code that allow you to create personalized experiences for your online store customers in their cart and at checkout.

Scripts are maintained, edited and published on a store by using the [Script Editor](https://help.shopify.com/manual/apps/apps-by-shopify/script-editor).

**Warning**: Shopify Gurus & Plus Success Managers do not support Scripts, they are a Plus only feature that are intended to provide extended functionality, and should only be implemented and/or altered by professional developers. If you are a Plus Merchant please contact your MSM and ask for an introduction to a partner.
